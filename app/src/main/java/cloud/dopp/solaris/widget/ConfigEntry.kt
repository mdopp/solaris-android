/**
 * How a widget's configuration screen was entered (#96).
 *
 * Declaring `android:widgetFeatures="reconfigurable"` is what puts *Einrichten*
 * into the launcher's long-press menu — the one entry an app may contribute
 * there. It also means every config activity is now re-entered on a widget that
 * already exists, and the two paths are **not** the same screen:
 *
 * On [FIRST_PLACEMENT] the host hands over a **fresh** `appWidgetId` and waits for
 * the verdict. Backing out must answer `RESULT_CANCELED` — that is how the host
 * learns to drop the half-placed widget again.
 *
 * On [RECONFIGURE] the same screen opens on an **already bound** id: the widget
 * sits on the homescreen and works, the user only asked to change what it points
 * at. `RESULT_CANCELED` there does not read as "nothing happened" but as "this
 * widget is not wanted", which hosts are free to act on — a cancelled edit could
 * take a working widget down with it. So the back-out answer flips to
 * `RESULT_OK` carrying the **unchanged** id: a no-op applied to a binding that
 * never moved.
