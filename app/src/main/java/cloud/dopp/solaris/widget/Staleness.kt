/**
 * "Wann haben **wir** zuletzt erfolgreich vom Server gehört?" — the widget-side
 * freshness decision (#111).
 *
 * The outage of 29./30.08. (solarisbay#1270) had every `/napi/` call answering
 * 500 for more than a day while the tiles kept showing their last values,
 * unchanged and perfectly plausible. Nothing threw — the providers render
 * *stale-then-fresh* (last-good cache first, re-fetch after), so when nothing
 * arrives the old value simply stays and [WidgetFallback], which only fires on a
 * thrown fetch/render, never sees anything. [cloud.dopp.solaris.realtime]'s
 * `flagDisconnect` did notice, but it writes to the ongoing notification, not to
 * a tile, and names no device.
 *
 * The one thing that must not be confused here is **which timestamp**:
 * `Card.updatedAtMs` is Home Assistant's *state* time (the ordering fuel for
 * `StateEpochGuard`) — a lamp that has been on, untouched, for a week is not
 * stale. What decides staleness is the **fetch time** of the last successful
 * refresh, recorded by [WidgetCache.noteFetch].
 *
 * Three rules are baked into the numbers and the wording below:
 * - **Do not cry wolf.** The device widget's host update period is 30 min, and
 *   Android may stretch it; [THRESHOLD_MS] sits at two full periods plus slack,
 *   so a network handover, one missed cycle, or a slow reconnect never marks a
 *   tile. A homescreen that flashes on every blip gets ignored — and then it does
 *   not help during the real outage either.
 * - **Mark, don't replace.** The last known value stays readable; the mark rides
 *   *next to* it. "Vor zwei Stunden war abgeschlossen" is useful, an empty error
 *   tile is not.
 * - **A lock may not assert what nobody checked.** Same rule as #84, where
 *   `unknown` must never look like *abgeschlossen* — a *stale* `abgeschlossen`
 *   falls under it too, so [staleValue] turns it into a question.
 *
 * The threshold answers the *passive* question — "has anything arrived lately?".
 * It cannot answer the active one, and the device test proved why: in flight mode
 * a tap raised the toast, but the tiles kept their colour, because 90 minutes had
 * obviously not passed. So the second input arrived: an **executed action is a
 * measurement of the connection** — the only one that happens exactly while the
 * user is looking. [markFor] folds it in; [ActionProbe] decides what an outcome
 * measured.
 *
 * Pure (no Android) → the whole decision is JVM-testable.

     * smallest window in which "nothing arrived" means the server, not the phone.
