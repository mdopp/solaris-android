/**
 * Which entries the **app-icon long-press** offers (#97).
 *
 * A long-press menu on the *widget* is impossible — that menu belongs to the
 * launcher and takes no app actions (#96) — so the device shortcuts live on the
 * app icon instead. They cannot be static: an XML list written at build time
 * cannot know the user's devices.
 *
 * **The source is the household catalogue** (#100) — the same list the device
 * picker offers — not the placed widgets. A quick action must not presuppose a
 * widget; requiring one was the reported defect.
 *
 * **The cap is asked for, never assumed.** `getMaxShortcutCountPerActivity()` is
 * passed in as [cap]; launchers commonly *show* four but neither the shown nor
 * the allowed number is fixed. Since the catalogue is far larger than the cap,
 * the order is what decides the menu, in three tiers:
 *
 * 1. **Last switched first** — [recent], the capped usage list [ShortcutUsage]
 *    keeps. This is the rule; the other two only fill the gap it leaves.
 * 2. Then the devices that *do* have a widget, newest instance first:
 *    `appWidgetId` is handed out by the `AppWidgetManager` in increasing order,
 *    so the newest widget carries the highest id. This is the whole order on a
 *    fresh install, where there is no history to sort by — the menu is then what
 *    #97 published, never empty and never arbitrary.
 * 3. Then the rest, in catalogue order (rooms, as the picker groups them).
 *
 * An entity in [recent] that is no longer in the catalogue simply does not
 * appear — it consumes no slot and is not resurrected from the history.
 *
 * **Security (#92 rules, unchanged here):** a lock never gets a directly-acting
 * entry. It gets [ShortcutAction.CHOOSE], which opens the very same chooser as
 * the 1×1 lock tile, behind the device lock and still subject to the server's
 * authoritative 403 `sensitive_action`. `lock.open` is named nowhere in this
 * file: no shortcut carries a service at all, so none can reach the latch. Every
 * other sensitive device (garage/door/gate cover, alarm panel) merely opens its
 * card. Pure (no Android) → JVM-testable, which is the point.
