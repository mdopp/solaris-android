 * and the colour palette with a list. Material puts the neutral button far left
 * and negative/positive right, so "Abbrechen" landed in a different place per
 * dialog — reported from the device as dangerous, because muscle memory then
 * hits the wrong thing.
 *
 * Here every dialog is the same object: a title, an optional question, a
 * vertical stack of actions, and **Abbrechen as a fixed footer**. [rows] appends
 * [ActionRow.Cancel] last for every sheet there can ever be, so the safe answer
 * is always in the same spot and no action can occupy it. The dangerous block is
 * kept apart the way #92 demanded — last in the stack, behind its own warning,
 * in the warning colour — but *above* Abbrechen, never in its place.
 *
 * Pure (resource ids only) → the whole arrangement is JVM-testable; only the
 * drawing is a device matter.
