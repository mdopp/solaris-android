/**
 * What a config screen must already show when it is **re-entered** (#96).
 *
 * All three pickers ([WidgetConfigActivity], [ToolWidgetConfigActivity],
 * [ToolLauncherConfigActivity]) knew the instance's binding on the reconfigure
 * path from the start — and still opened looking exactly like a first placement
 * on the device. Two reasons, both fixed here:
 *
 * 1. **The mark was invisible.** It was a `· aktuell` suffix appended to one row
 *    among dozens — on the device picker, to the muted 13sp *second* line. Nothing
 *    told the eye which row it was, so the screen read as "starts empty" and, worse,
 *    as if the binding had been lost.
 * 2. **The row was merely on screen, not in front of the user.**
 *    `ListView.setSelection` in touch mode only guarantees visibility: it hands the
 *    list a layout hint that the end-of-list clamp is free to pull back, so the
 *    marked row lands at the bottom edge as readily as at the top. Measured on the
 *    JVM: a list of 30 with row 25 bound laid out at `firstVisiblePosition = 5`.
 *
 * So the mark is now a **painted row** — accent tint plus a check glyph, [paint] —
 * and the scroll puts it at the **top**, [scrollTo].
 *
 * The index itself is the one piece of logic worth pinning on the JVM, so it lives
 * here rather than inline in three activities: [markedIndex] is the whole rule —
 * a reconfigure marks the row carrying the current binding, a first placement
 * marks **nothing**, whatever the store happens to hold.
