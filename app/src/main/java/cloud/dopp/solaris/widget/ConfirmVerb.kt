/**
 * The wording a confirm dialog uses for a Home-Assistant service (#85).
 *
 * The old rule was `service.contains("close")`, which reads `cover.close_cover`
 * correctly but sends `lock.lock` and `alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_away` down
 * the *open* branch — the dialog then asked about opening while the user was
 * locking up. This is the replacement: a pure, Android-free mapping from the
 * dotted `domain.action` service to a verb, each verb carrying its
 * [ConfirmDirection] so the positive button can never contradict the question.
 *
 * A lock gets its own words on purpose: `lock.lock` is *abschließen*, not
 * *schließen*, and `lock.open` (the door latch/buzzer) is not `lock.unlock`.
 * Anything unrecognised maps to [NEUTRAL] — never a guessed direction.
