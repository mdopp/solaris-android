/**
 * Finishing what `requestPinAppWidget` starts (#105).
 *
 * The in-app offers place widgets with `requestPinAppWidget`. Its **third**
 * argument is the `successCallback` — the only channel through which the app ever
 * learns the `appWidgetId` the host just assigned. Every call passed `null` and
 * relied on the provider's `configure` activity being started for the new
 * instance instead. **It is not**: the host places the widget and is done, so a
 * tool widget pinned from the app landed unbound and showed "Tool wählen" while
 * the picked tool sat parked in [WidgetStore.setPendingToolId] until its TTL ran
 * out. Confirmed on the device: long-press → *Einrichten* (which starts the
 * config activity by hand) redeemed the parked id and the rows appeared.
 *
 * So the callback is the primary path now and the parked id stays as the
 * **fallback** for hosts that do start the config activity. Both can reach the
 * same fresh instance, and together they must bind **exactly once**:
 * [WidgetStore.isBound] is that guard — whoever arrives first binds, the loser
 * steps aside — and the winner of the callback race spends the parked id
 * ([WidgetStore.clearPendingToolId]) so the config screen has nothing left to
 * re-bind from.
 *
 * Providers without a tool to bind get the callback too, for the same reason the
 * ticket names: they are one `configure` attribute away from the identical hole.
 * They are only [nudge]d into a redraw, **not** pushed into their config screen —
 * a host that *does* run the config activity would then be showing one in its own
 * task while we open a second in ours, and backing out of a first placement
 * answers `RESULT_CANCELED`, which costs the user the widget. The way out of an
 * unbound tile is its own tap instead (#104 for the 1×1 device tile,
 * [ToolWidgetProvider] and [ToolLauncherWidgetProvider] here).
