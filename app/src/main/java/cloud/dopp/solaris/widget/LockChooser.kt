/**
 * What the 1×1 lock tile's chooser offers (#92).

 * blind: the tile shows barely any state there, so a mistap flipped the bolt of
 * the front door. The tap now opens a chooser instead, and **the chooser is the
 * confirmation** — there is no longer any path that acts without an explicit
 * pick, and no second dialog on top of it.
 *
 * `lock.open` is the odd one out. The server does not block it — solarisbay
 * #1212 allowlists the whole `lock` domain on `/napi/ha/call` and gates every
 * `lock.*` with the authoritative 403 `sensitive_action` — but the *lock* may
 * not have a latch at all. HA advertises one via `LockEntityFeature.OPEN`, bit 0
 * of the entity's `supported_features`, which `card_spec` forwards. No proof of
 * that bit ⇒ no door-opening entry: a missing capability must never render as an
 * offer to open the house.
 *
 * Pure (no Android) → JVM-testable, which is the point: this decides the one
 * thing that must never be got wrong by accident.
