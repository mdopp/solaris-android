/**
 * An executed action, read as a **measurement of the connection** (#111).
 *
 * The device test of v2.33.0 in flight mode showed the gap: the tap raised its
 * toast, but the tiles did not change, because [Staleness.THRESHOLD_MS] is 90
 * minutes and a minute of flight mode cannot reach it. The threshold is right —
 * a tile only refreshes every 30 min, and a shorter window would cry wolf — so
 * the answer is not a shorter threshold but a **second input**: the action the
 * user just triggered is the one measurement that happens exactly when they are
 * looking, and it costs no extra request.
 *
 * - It **failed to reach** the server → we know *now* that it is unreachable.
 *   The tile is marked at once, no waiting. This is not a false alarm: the user
 *   has just experienced first-hand that nothing happened.
 * - It **reached** the server → we have heard from it this second. That is a
 *   fresh fetch time, and it clears an existing mark even though no regular
 *   refresh ran.
 *
 * The distinction that keeps this honest is **who answered**. A refusal the
 * server *authored* — the 403 confirm gate, a `forbidden` admin action, an
 * `unknown_action` 404 — proves it is alive; only silence (a transport error) or
 * a server that cannot serve its own endpoint (the outage's 500s, which
 * [ApiClient.call] collapses to `false`) is [Reach.UNREACHABLE]. And an action
 * that never left the phone — nothing paired, nothing configured — measured
 * nothing at all: [Reach.NOTHING] writes no verdict rather than a wrong one.
 *
 * The classifiers are pure; [record] is the only line that touches storage.
 *
 * Only the **device tile** is probed, because it is the only surface that renders
 * a freshness mark. And only a **user-triggered action** may write here: a failing
 * background refresh must never mark anything, or the 90-minute threshold — the
 * whole defence against crying wolf — would be back-doored on the first bad
 * network handover.
